# composite_bars_solver

In Strength of Materials there's a topic for composite bars.
It's used to find the optimum amount of materials to hold the load without damage
by calculating it's stresses and loads acting on individual materials.

It was given as school homework and I wrote a program to solve it with if conditions and loops to fit the procedure.

To make it work:
1. You have to enter the number of materials used in it.
2. Enter the total load acting on them.
3. Enter the Youngs modulus of the materials.
4. Choose the length of them 
   (either same length or different, if they are not same enter their corresponding lengths)  
5. Choose a type and enter their corresponding areas.

That's it. Now you'll be shown stresses and load shared by each materials.

Note : 
 Since it is raw program,make sure that the values you enter are in same units,
 and keep track of the output units according to input units.

# composite_bars_solver

In Strength of Materials there's a topic for composite bars.
It's used to find the optimum amount of materals to hold the load without damage
by calculating its stresses and loads acting on individual materials.

It was given as school homework and I wote a program to solve it with conditions and loops to fit the procedure.

To make it work:
1. You have to enter the number of materials used it it.
2. Enter the total load acting on them.
3. Enter the Youngs modulus of the materials.
4. Choose the length of them 
   (either same length or different, if they are noot same enter their coresponding lengths)  
5.
